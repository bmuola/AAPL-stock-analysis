**Calculate and view the RSI.**
 ```sql

-- Step 1: Calculate Price Changes --
WITH price_changes_custom AS (
    SELECT
        date,
        close,
        LEAD(close) OVER (ORDER BY date) - close AS price_change
    FROM
        aaplstock.trends.updates
),

-- Step 2: Calculate Gains and Losses --
gains_losses_custom AS (
    SELECT
        date,
        close,
        CASE
            WHEN price_change > 0 THEN price_change
            ELSE 0
        END AS gain,
        CASE
            WHEN price_change < 0 THEN ABS(price_change)
            ELSE 0
        END AS loss
    FROM
        price_changes_custom
),

-- Step 3: Calculate Average Gains and Losses --
average_gains_losses_custom AS (
    SELECT
        date,
        close,
        AVG(gain) OVER (ORDER BY date ROWS BETWEEN 13 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW) AS avg_gain,
        AVG(loss) OVER (ORDER BY date ROWS BETWEEN 13 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW) AS avg_loss
    FROM
        gains_losses_custom
)

-- Step 4: Calculate RSI_trend (RSI) --
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW RSI_trend AS (
    SELECT
        date,
        close,
        100 - (100 / (1 + (avg_gain / avg_loss))) AS rsi
    FROM
        average_gains_losses_custom
    WHERE
        avg_loss <> 0
);
